# codahead

me) specifically mentions that he did not use mvp in a long time
others) let's checkout how well he knows mvp
:D

Limitations:
- no dependency injection, which means the view creates the presenter (separation of concerns, testability) - It's been a while since I used
dagger and I forgot how difficult it is to setup, I gave up and went on with more essential functionality
- no tests :( because of time

Future improvements:
- store the lists in sqllite/room/realm database so it's possible to use app offline
- add dependency injection
